# U-Net Model for Image Segmentation

## Introduction
This project implements the **U-Net model** for **image segmentation**, specifically for segmenting roads from satellite or aerial imagery. The U-Net architecture is widely used in biomedical image segmentation and can be effectively applied to other image segmentation tasks as well. This model consists of an **encoder-decoder** structure with skip connections that help in preserving the spatial information.

The dataset used is the **Road Segmentation Dataset**, containing images of roads and their corresponding segmentation masks.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **U-Net Model Overview**
U-Net is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for image segmentation. The architecture consists of an encoding path that captures contextual information and a decoding path that enables precise localization. Skip connections between the encoding and decoding paths help retain spatial information during the upsampling process.

### 2. **Key Features**
- **Encoder Path**: Uses convolution and pooling layers to capture high-level features while progressively reducing spatial dimensions.
- **Decoder Path**: Uses transposed convolutions to restore spatial resolution and produce the segmentation mask.
- **Skip Connections**: Directly connects corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder to preserve spatial information.

### 3. **U-Net Variants**
The model can be enhanced with different variants like:
- **VGG U-Net**: Incorporates VGG-style convolutions.
- **Residual U-Net**: Uses residual blocks for improved training.
- **Attention U-Net**: Focuses on important regions in the image.
- **Dense U-Net**: Uses DenseNet-style blocks to improve feature reuse.
